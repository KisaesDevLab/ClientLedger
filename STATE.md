## Blocked items

Format: `Pxx — blocked by U-xx/Q-xx — what is pending — workaround in place`.

- P39 (release) — owner decision needed on Q-P03e — the bundled PostgreSQL archives ship LGPL libraries (gettext/libiconv on Windows) and OpenSSL, ICU, libxml2 and others on Linux/macOS; the owner must confirm the licensing position (license texts shipped, any written source offer) before beta release — workaround in place: libraries kept unmodified and listed in ATTRIBUTION.md.

- P05 AC4 — blocked by U-17 — real-engine 409 contract test is PENDING(record-version-v1) — stub contract covers the client (`If-Match` sent, 409 `STALE` mapped to `Conflict { Stale }`, fingerprint check sends nothing).

- P08 Delete Company (Q-185) — blocked by U-05 E5b (`tenant-delete-v1`) — `lifecycle::safe_delete_e5b` is PENDING — in place: the window explains it and keeps the button off; cl-company refuses without a before-delete backup path and SHA-256 (nothing sent) and removes the local record only after the engine's receipt.
- P08 Recovery key (Q-210) — blocked by U-23 (`recovery-key-v1`) — `lifecycle::recovery_key_u23` is PENDING — in place: the screen (show once, copy, save, confirm) runs on the key `/desktop/initialize` returns or a rotated one; without the capability it says so.
- P08 Full Database Backup (File > Utilities) — needs a supervisor-side `pg_dump` API while the cluster runs — placeholder window; P34 (Q-P08l).
- P11 Chart of Accounts merge — blocked by U-31 (engine merge moves no journal lines; `/accounts/:id/ledger` empty) — merge not built — in place: merge hidden (`merge_available: false`), QuickReport uses `/reports/account-report` (Q-P11a, Q-P11i).
- P11 parent-plus-sub-account balance — blocked by U-32 — PENDING — in place: each account's own engine balance only, with a note under the chart; `parentId` checked in `cl_model::lists::accounts::check` (Q-P11b).
- P11 sensitive accounts enforcement — blocked by U-33 (and P29) — PENDING — in place: the mark is stored locally in `CompanyPrefs.sensitive_accounts` and shown (Q-P11c).
- P11 masked bank or card number with logged Admin reveal (Q-154) — blocked by U-34 — PENDING — in place: the field is shown switched off with "not available yet" on bank and credit-card accounts (Q-P11d).
- P11 jobs in the Client center (Q-90) — blocked by U-35 — `contacts::jobs_u35` is PENDING — in place: clients only; the Jobs tab says jobs aren't available yet (Q-P11j).
- P11 several ship-to addresses and contact people with roles (Q-128, Q-129) — blocked by U-36 — `contacts::addresses_u36` is PENDING — in place: one bill-to and one ship-to, single person/email fields, with a note in the pane (Q-P11k).
- P11 dated notes and to-dos (Q-130) — blocked by U-37 — `contacts::notes_u37` is PENDING — in place: the single notes field in the Notes tab, with a note that dated notes and to-dos arrive later (Q-P11l).
- P11 per-contact open balance — blocked by U-38 — `contacts::open_balance_u38` is PENDING — in place: figures from the client balance summary and vendor aging reports, labelled with their source, never summed in the UI (Q-P11m).
- P11 recording a paper W-9 — blocked by U-44 — `contacts::w9_on_file_u44` is PENDING — in place: W-9 on file shown read-only, the form says recording it isn't available yet (Q-P11n).
- P11 item kinds other than service, the purchase side of two-sided items and the unit label (Q-58, Q-96, Q-99) — blocked by U-39 — `items::item_types_u39` is PENDING — in place: service items only, the panel says the rest isn't available yet (Q-P11q).
- P11 price levels (Q-58) — blocked by U-40 — `items::price_levels_u40` is PENDING — in place: a note under the Item List (Q-P11r).
- P11 one tag per group in the engine, group reorder — blocked by U-41 — `tags::single_select_u41`, `tags::group_reorder_u41` are PENDING — in place: the forms enforce one per group, groups keep the engine's order (Q-P11v). Merging tags used on lines or as defaults works since pin 7b267e48 (U-47, Q-P11t).
- P11 required tag groups by account type (Q-180) — blocked by U-42 — `tags::required_groups_u42` is PENDING — in place: kept on the company record and enforced by the forms' rule check (Q-P11u).
- P11/P13 several tags on one line (Q-179, Q-P10t) — blocked by U-45 — `tags::several_line_tags_u45` is PENDING — in place: one tag per line, refused in plain words before saving (Q-P11w).
- P11 your own terms (including discount terms) and payment methods — blocked by U-43 — `list_csv::terms_lists_u43` is PENDING — in place: the engine's fixed lists, read-only, with a note (Q-P11y).
- P11 item CSV import in one call and full contact rows — blocked by U-46 — `list_csv::items_import_u46` is PENDING — in place: items created one at a time; contacts import name, company, email and phone only (Q-P11x).
- P12 toggling cleared marks in the register (R5) — blocked by `register-cleared-v1` — in place: ✓/R read-only (Q-P12k). Also still PENDING for P12: U-17 (server-side version check; fingerprint stopgap); U-18 (idempotency keys) is live since pin f3ce33fd.

## Placeholders tracked

Screens or actions that link to a later phase. Remove each line when its phase lands.

- P34/P08 — restore UI must call `Cluster::restore(src, store, allow_unregistered)` with `allow_unregistered = false` by default and set it to `true` only after an explicit owner confirmation that the file came from a trusted source (Q-P03h).

- P06 shell placeholders (Q-P06g): every menu, rail and palette command whose screen is built later opens a placeholder tab. The phase that builds the screen removes its entry: P11 Item List / Tags / Clients & Jobs / Vendors, P12 Open Register, P13 Write Check, P14 Make Deposit / Transfer Funds / Sales Receipt / Record Card Charge, P18 Pay Bills, P20 Create Invoice, P21 Receive Payment, P22 Credit Memo or Refund / Statements, P25 Import Bank File, P26 Bank Feed, P27 Reconcile, P28 Reports / Profit & Loss / Balance Sheet / Trial Balance, P29 Set Closing Date / Users and Permissions / Audit Trail, P30 Import Payroll, P32 Send to My Accountant, P38 bundled help (F1 says "not available yet").
- P06 native macOS menu bar (Q-70, muda) is deferred (Q-P06b): in-window menu on every platform until macOS packaging.
- P16 Home lane actions open "arrives in Pxx" placeholders (Q-P16k): P18 Pay Bills, P20 Create Invoice / Sales Receipt, P21 Receive Payment, P26 Review Bank Feed, P27 Reconcile, P28 Profit & Loss, P29 Set Closing Date, P32 Send to My Accountant. Each phase wires its lane action.
- P16 Home chart: a month click opens the Profit & Loss placeholder; P28 must open the report for that month's range (Q-P16h).
- P16 Home "Bank file" balance column — U-77 / P25 (Q-P16d); "ready to accept" count — P26 (Q-P16f); "invoices more than 60 days past due" — P28 aging (Q-P16g); "Send to My Accountant · last sent" — P32 (Q-P16i).
- P16 Needs attention placeholder line for to-dos, reorder alerts and the weekly health check — U-37, U-78, U-12 (Q-P16e).

## Follow-ups from P03 security review

Findings from the P03 security review that were not fixed in P03. Fixed in P03: 1 (crafted backup runs code on restore), 2 and 15 (stop signalling an unrelated process), 3 (backup file mode on Unix), 5, 8, 12, 13, 14. Each item below names the phase that must pick it up; remove the line when it lands.

| # | Follow-up | Target |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 4 | Limit extraction size and check free disk space before unpacking a backup (a hostile archive can expand without bound). Company restores go through the engine's import, which caps sizes (P02 §2.5); the whole-cluster restore UI is P34. | P34 |
| 6 | A keychain hiccup must not downgrade an already initialized cluster to the file fallback store. Not done in P09 (no `cl-pg` touch; P09 only added keychain entries through `cl-settings`). | next `cl-pg` touch / P37 |
| 7 | Derive the fallback file key from OS APIs, not environment variables (user name, computer name). Not done in P09 (no `cl-pg` touch). | next `cl-pg` touch / P37 |
| 9 | Truncate `postgresql.auto.conf` on every start (restore already resets it). | next `cl-pg` touch (P04) |
| 10 | The engine must connect as a non-superuser application role, not the `postgres` superuser. | P04 |
| 11 | Owner-only ACL on the data directory, the `.secret` file, and backups on Windows (Unix backups are already 0600). Not done in P09. | P35 / P37 |
| 16 | Treat gvfs `smb-share:`, `sftp:`, and `dav:` mounts as network drives in `check_data_dir`. Not done in P08 (no `cl-pg` touch); next `cl-pg` touch or P35. | P35 |
| 17 | Canonicalize the parent folder when checking that a backup is not inside the data directory. | next `cl-pg` touch |
| 18 | `pg-fetch`: pass `--proto-redir =https --tlsv1.2` to curl, and consider verifying the Maven `.asc` signature when the pinned hashes are bumped. | next hash bump / P35 |

Notes kept for later phases:

- `startup.log` (the `pg_ctl -l` file) must stay outside the data directory: on Windows, after a crash the server fsyncs every file in the data directory and fails with a sharing violation on a log file that is still open (stalls startup).
- Pid-file ownership uses the pid, process name, and data directory from `postmaster.pid`; the process start time is not compared (no portable OS call without more dependencies).
- A running server whose pid file shows non-loopback settings is stopped and restarted (unit-tested on the pid file fields; no integration test starts a wider server).

## Follow-ups from P04 security review

No Critical or High findings. Fixed on `phase/P04-supervisor`: M1, M2, L1, L2, L5, L6, L7, L9, L10, L11 (see Q-P04p). Recorded, not fixed:

| # | Follow-up | Target |
|---|-----------|--------|
| M3 | Windows custom or portable data folders inherit "Authenticated Users: Modify": set an owner-only ACL or refuse such roots; the file-store key derivation is not protective on shared folders (Q-P04l, Q-P03c). | P35 / P09 |
| L3 | Fail closed after N failed listener lookups instead of warning forever (Q-P04m). | P37 |
| L4 | `cl-api` re-reads endpoint and generation for every request and verifies the listener before the first request after a restart; host `info`/`initialize` should verify the listener first (Q-P04n). | P05 |
| L8 | Engine exits when stdin closes / `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` (added to U-16); write `run/engine.pid` atomically with the spawn (Q-P04o). | U-16 / P37 |
| Info | Suspended start under the job object and fail if job creation fails; no Node diagnostic reports; WER exclusion; secrets never rotate, so P34 recovery guidance must cover them (Q-P04o). | P35 / P34 / P37 |

## Follow-ups from P05 reviews

Fixed on `phase/P05-engine-client`: scope pinning (both reviews), Retry-After overflow (L1), Call `Debug` (L2), endpoint unpublished on engine exit (L3), candidate id parsing (L5), test-feature guard (L6), DNS block and checkout credentials (L7), code-review should-fix 1-4 and the nits (Q-P05ad). Recorded, not fixed:

| # | Follow-up | Target |
|---|-----------|--------|
| L4 | Best-effort secret wipe: zeroizing/constant-time `cl_pg::Secret` (or re-export `cl_core::Secret`), pre-sized `Zeroizing` body buffers (Q-P05aa). | P09 / P37 |
| L8 | Lint or review rule against logging `ApiError` payloads, models or amounts with `?value` at info level (Q-P05ab). | P37 |
| L9 | 64 KiB cap for engine error bodies (Q-P05ac). | P37 |
| AC5 | No contract test yet moves a transaction OUT of a closed period (old date closed, new date open); the engine checks both dates, the stub suite covers the client mapping. | P07 (with U-15) |

## Follow-ups from P10

- S14 tag gap (Q-P10t): engine lines hold one `tagId`; the grid allows several tag chips per line. P11 opened U-45 (several tags per line, Q-P11w); until it lands, P13 refuses to save a line with more than one tag through `cl_model::lists::tags::engine_line_tag`.

## Follow-ups from P13

1. ~~A register tab left open shows stale rows after another window saves.~~ Fixed in P14 by the cross-window refresh bus (Q-262).
2. ~~Native file picker for attachments (Q-P13k).~~ Done in A01 (Browse on Enter Bill and Write Check, `rfd`).
3. The `cl-host` cold-start budget test exceeds the 15 s local limit under load (CI uses `CL_HOST_BUDGET_SECS=30`).
4. Engine issues #157 (duplicate check numbers under concurrency) and #158 (float compare in the rules engine).

## Follow-ups from P14

1. The control channel can't click dropdown options scrolled out of view (automation limitation); scenarios choose options that are visible (Q-P14z).
2. The demo stores no tags on daily-sales days.
3. Engine issues #154, #155, #157 and #158 are still open.
4. Engine main CI (npm-audit) is failing; pre-existing, not caused by PR #159.
5. The vendor A/P aging summary lists bills only; vendor refunds are not reflected there (the vendor statement shows them).

## Follow-ups from P15

1. Engine issue #162: flaky pgboss-owner-role test (not caused by PRs #160 or #161).
2. Make Journal Entry has no side panel and no History yet (Q-P15z).
3. The demo ledger doesn't store basis.
4. A `--demo` launch skips the catch-up (File > Open Company runs it).

## Follow-ups from P15A

1. Engine issue #164: the engine accepts postings to inactive accounts (Q-P15Ar).
2. The `BATCH_BUSY` path is not exercised live (Q-P15Aq).
3. The `cl-host` cold-start budget still exceeds 15 s locally under load (CI uses 30/60 s).
4. The `cl-automation` control-port test flakes under parallel local load.

## Follow-ups from P16

1. Tag CSV export (`csv_import.rs`) doesn't carry tag numbers yet.
2. `cl-pg fresh_start` exceeds its 10 s budget under parallel local builds (passes alone).
3. This Windows dev machine has Smart App Control enforcing; it sometimes blocks a freshly built test binary (os error 4551). Re-running or touching a source file works; the owner is turning it off for development (2026-10-24).
4. The `recovery-key` scenario fails on this machine on `main` too: the long temp path is wider than the "Save to file" box (`recovery-key.yaml:44`, `assert_no_clipping`). Widen the box or let it scroll.
5. `cargo xtask keymap-doc` (shortcuts cheatsheet) omits the fixed grid keys that KEYBOARD.md lists (Shift+F10, Shift+↑/↓, Alt+↑/↓).
6. U-79 (proposed): `/bills` status filter / leave voided bills out; Home counts posted bills client-side until then (Q-P16r).
7. U-77 bank-file balance and U-78 reorder alerts proposed; U-37 and U-12 amended for Home.
8. Home's Refresh issues many engine reads per data-bus event (one per reconciled account batch plus lanes); measure before P33 LAN mode.

## Follow-ups from A06

1. Photos of statements read 79.6 % (seen) / 73.5 % (held-out) of lines right; most misses are OCR letter errors in reference numbers. Revisit at PR-A1 with `private-fixtures/`.
2. A read still overwrites typed box text without asking; typing in the box waives the read marks.
3. No test yet that a 20-page, 2,000-line statement fits the worker's 8 MiB reply cap; the read table isn't virtualized (redraw cost fixed, S7).
4. Statement layouts learn header fields only (the template model has no statement column types).
5. Live contract test `drafts::statement_drafts` ran only its PENDING path locally (engine build before U-94); CI runs it on pin 5a9a8700.
6. Region re-read on a statement still stops at page 10.

## Follow-ups from A04

1. Pointer drags (draw a box to re-read a region) can't be scripted: the automation tools click and move but can't press, drag and release. Unit tests only.
2. "Enter this as" is checked on screen only; the "Ask AI to help" row in drafts isn't exercised in the demo; Alt+E (Enter as new) unchecked in a scenario; AccessKit inspect of the compare overlay skipped.
3. `doc_review_forms` fails in dark at step 19 (draft not loaded in time, likely state left by the light run); `doc_compare`, `doc_review` and `receipt_inbox` not re-run after the fix pass.
4. A Write Check opened from an unread draft shows today's date but has none until the owner types one; Save refuses. Fill the date or show the field empty.
5. Engine follow-ups U-98 (reopen an attached draft), U-99 (no-vendor duplicate guard), U-100 (Read again).

## Follow-ups from A03

1. One seen document type (PDFs without a text layer, 7 docs) clears its 85 % gate by one document; the hand-style font confuses OCR digits. Re-measure on `private-fixtures/` at the milestone review.
2. Every Preferences save with an online AI provider re-accepts the AI notice (P09 behaviour); harmless now that the document switches are read back from the engine, but worth a P29 look.
3. macOS has no hard memory cap for the worker (RLIMIT_DATA doesn't cover mmap); tesseract on Linux/macOS has the watchdog and CPU limit only (Q-A03c). A Rust abort on Windows can still reach WER (P37).
4. Too-large page pictures (> 4096 px) are not sent to AI; the text goes alone and the banner says so (no downscaling yet).
5. Held-out vendor accuracy dipped one document on scan/template-scan after the "printed name beats layout" fix; watch it.
6. "Network off" in the bill scenario is shown by zero AI requests, not an enforced block; enforced sandboxes in P37.
7. `omit_document_drafts` / `reset_document_drafts` are unused until P32 (transfer files).
8. Account form create-then-set card digits has no live-engine test (the save path itself is tested live).
9. Flaky on slow macOS Intel runners: `automation::bridge_tests::a_closed_window_is_forgotten` (A02) failed once on PR #44 (`before.is_ok()`); passed on re-run. Make its first inspect wait for the child window's first frame.

## Follow-ups from A02

1. Screen readers don't see the pop-out window: eframe 0.37 connects AccessKit only to the main window (Q-A02n). Revisit on an eframe upgrade.
2. eframe gives no monitor origin for a child window; placement assumes monitors side by side from the origin. A second-monitor user who docks and pops before dragging loses the saved place once per session (Q-A02c).
3. No scenario for the viewer following a register item (needs a saved transaction with a file in the demo); shell and unit tests only.
4. Untested edge cases: PDFium missing while popped out, a reloaded form getting a new document key (409), following a P06 popped-out tab.
5. A TIFF page can briefly hold its decoded buffer and the RGBA copy together (up to 512 MiB at the limit); the viewer window's keymap copy refreshes only on a mode change; a popped P06 tab shows "open in its own window" for a document the viewer isn't showing.
6. Write Check's Preview still opens the document tab (document-view.yaml depends on it).

## Follow-ups from A01

1. **Owner manual check pending:** add a real mapped drive and a real UNC share (`\\server\share`) as intake folders, copy a PDF into each (appears within 15 s), New bill → original in `Processed\<year-month>\`, Discard → `Discarded\`, disconnect → "unreachable" without freezing, reconnect → recovers. Automated tests cover local folders live and shares through a simulated file system only.
2. LAN mode (P33): each workstation watches its own confirmed folders (owner, Q-289). Duplicate prevention must become engine-wide (an attachment content hash and a claim on arrival) before P33; plan it with A03/A04 (U-92) or a separate U-row.
3. Transfer files: P32 must set `omitIntakeSettings` on export and `resetIntakeSettings` on import (Q-A01l).
4. Polling every 8 s (no license-clean watcher crate) lists network shares about 25% more often than the planned 10 s (Q-A01d); measure on slow shares.
5. The inbox list is rebuilt from files × entries each frame; fine at demo size, revisit at 20 folders × 500 files.
6. The engine's attachment delete audit row includes the file name in `before` (pre-existing); Discard now creates such rows. Engine follow-up.
7. On Linux the Browse dialog uses the desktop portal over the system `libdbus-1` and falls back to `zenity`; check on the AppImage/deb targets (P35).
8. HEIC: research a permissive decoder in A02 (Q-292).
9. Restore had refused every real engine backup since P08 (manifest past the first 64 archive entries); fixed in A01 (c9f77a5). Only mocked archives had been tested before; the live intake test now restores a real backup.
10. Disk: each parallel worktree keeps its own Cargo target (130–300 GB each); four filled the 932 GB drive on 2026-10-26 (CI failed with os error 112). Delete idle worktree target folders after each phase; sccache keeps rebuilds cheaper.

## Follow-ups from P17

1. Scanned (image-only) PDFs can't be read with AI: no permissive rasterizer, poppler is GPL. The app says so (Q-P17o). ADD-01 A03 (local OCR) is the fix.
2. "Add as a new vendor?" after a reading opens the vendor list, not a prefilled vendor form (Q-P17u).
3. `OpenRecord` on a bill-payment row opens Enter Bill empty; Pay Bills (P18) owns bill payments.
4. No automatic backup is taken before the engine runs its database migrations on an engine upgrade (non-negotiable 9). Build it with the upgrade flow (P36) or sooner; no release before then.
5. Engine download tokens can be replayed for 60 seconds (stateless signed tokens; U-90 review L1). Revisit before P33 LAN mode.
6. Bill templates: the engine has no `bill` template kind (Save as Template disabled, Q-P17a). Propose a U-row when bill templates are wanted.
7. PDFium renders in the desktop process on a worker thread (P17 plan R3); a sandboxed render helper through cl-host is a P37 follow-up. PDFium and its bundled libraries (FreeType under FTL) go into the P39 licensing review with Q-P03e.
8. Statement match reads at most 20 × 50 bills/credits and 10 × 100 payments and says so when capped; measure on large vendors.
9. Walkthrough harness: a light run that failed while zoomed left the dark run's window at 2× (fixed in P17: zoom reset before each theme). Watch for other state carried between themes.
10. Dev machine: Smart App Control is off (2026-10-25); Bitdefender is the active antivirus, so build exclusions belong in Bitdefender. The user-level Cargo config uses sccache, rust-lld and line-tables-only debug info (not in the repo).
11. Two engine test files also fail locally on Windows on engine main (portal bill-captures email timing, portal tax-estimate options); not caused by ClientLedger PRs.
12. Write Check, Card Charge and Personal Funds tab their bottom buttons in reverse screen order, and Write Check's Esc leaves nothing focused after putting a field back (fixed on Enter Bill in P17; same fix to apply there).
13. The shell's "Navigation" button overlaps the tab strip at 200% zoom in a 960×640 window (older shell code; zoom steps skip the tab strip as forms-zoom does).

## Follow-ups from checkpoint PR-1

1. The unknown-save block lasts for the app session; an app restart forgets it (Q-PR1a). U-18 closes this.
2. Security note from the review: `GET /transactions/:id` and `POST /transactions/:id/void` don't scope by company (moot while one tenant is one company); security-review before P33 LAN mode.
3. With a menu open, Escape closed the Register tab instead of only the menu (seen while writing the shell scenario for PR #35). Check and fix.
4. Not covered by the PR-1 review (cover in a later checkpoint): Daily Sales end to end, LAN concurrency (U-17), Undeposited Funds and A/P subledger tie-out, template CRUD audit rows, Bulk Entry engine validate/plan, printed-form rounding (P19).
5. Contact merge in closed periods (review S1) is fixed by U-47 (engine PR #170, pinned).

Report to the owner; fix findings on a `fix/` branch.

## Log

Newest first. One entry per completed phase: date, phase, summary, acceptance checklist results, notable decisions (Q-xx / U-xx).

Older entries (P00–P07, engine and planning notes) are in [docs/history/STATE-log.md](docs/history/STATE-log.md). Keep at most the last four entries here; the bookkeeper moves older ones there when a phase closes.

- 2026-10-27 — A06 (ADD-02) complete on `phase/A06-statement-reading`; PR with auto-merge. Shipped:
  - `cl-docread` statement reading in the sandboxed worker (protocol v5): header (statement date, period, opening and closing), line table with the sign from its column (single / charges / credits / payments, running balance), multi-page tables, balance-forward, subtotal, total and aging rows left out (Q-296); checks for sum, running balance, period and duplicates, flagged and never adjusted; 20 pages and 2,000 lines per statement (Q-300); `stmt:` statement layouts kept apart from bill layouts (Q-A06e).
  - Match Vendor Statement "Read a statement file" (Browse, drop, Review Documents, Vendor statements intake folders): read lines become the box's rows and go through the existing Match (Q-A06b); statement beside its lines with line ↔ spot highlights; read marks; Accept / Alt+A before Match; "Ask AI to help" suggests only vendor and closing balance, each needing "Use this…"; wrong-vendor warning; "Couldn't read this statement…".
  - Balance line from the engine's vendor-statement report read as CSV, exact difference, display only (Q-297, Q-A06c). "Save this statement with the vendor" (contact attachment, period in the file name; from a draft: copy, discard, delete; Q-A06d).
  - Engine U-94 (PR #183: statement draft kind, `statements` intake kind, `document-drafts-statement-v1`, migration 0235) merged; pin 5a9a8700. Synthetic statements (15 layouts, 3 held out) and the statement lines gate in `docread-accuracy`.
  Acceptance (addenda/ADD-02-statement-reading.md A06; photos per owner amendment Q-A06h):
  - [x] AI off, offline: lines right on text PDFs 100 % (seen and held-out), scans 96.6 % / 94.5 %, photos 79.6 % / 73.5 % (targets 95 / 85 / 75 seen, 70 held-out).
  - [x] Totals that don't reconcile are flagged and never adjusted (property test with injected errors).
  - [x] Read lines go through the existing Match exactly as typed lines; nothing posts without the owner (`rows_from_read` round trip incl. credits under Charges; `statement_match` scenario).
  - [x] The statement is shown beside its lines, each line linked to its spot (scenario clicks a line and a box, light and dark).
  - [x] A malformed or hostile file can't crash or hang the desktop (worker limits, page and line caps, reply cap tested).
  Reviews: one combined review (2 blocking: credits under Charges became charges; save could file on the wrong vendor; 7 should-fix; all fixed except S5, settled by the owner's photo amendment), ui-verifier (statement above the lines, Create credit on a payment, and 6 more; fixed). Full local CI once; GitHub CI on the PR.
  Agents: scout/opus, impl/opus ×2 (WP-S1 reading, WP-S2 screen), engine-impl/opus (U-94 + 3 follow-ups), review/opus, impl/opus (review fixes), ui-verifier/opus, impl/opus (screen fixes), impl/sonnet (pin bump), docs-writer/sonnet. Plan by the orchestrator (Tier M, Q-301).
- 2026-10-27 — A04 (ADD-01) complete on `phase/A04-review-queue`; PR with auto-merge. Shipped:
  - Review queue: files from intake folders become document drafts on arrival (claim on arrival, inbox state v3, `DraftLink`); rows show kind, arrival date and file name; keyboard through the whole queue.
  - Draft → form: "Enter this as" bill, card charge or check; the form opens filled from the read with the document beside it (docked or popped out); convert or attach through `DraftSession`; HMAC digest over the request body actually sent (`ConvertBody::wire_body`).
  - Compare tools: highlights linking each filled field to its spot on the page, click to fill, the check list; one "Filled from" banner naming a saved layout.
  - Duplicates: the register is searched before any closing-date password; a failed search never posts (Try again / Enter as new / Back); an engine match attaches only at the exact total, ±7 days and an allowed kind (`register_match` allowlist by `Probe.side`); attach never changes the books.
  - Reading in the worker gained a region re-read (protocol v4); "Ask AI to help" in drafts; vendor layouts learned on accept; demo drafts backend.
  - Engine PRs #180 (U-95, document-drafts-attach-v1) and #182 (U-97, archive reader splits no multi-byte characters) merged; pin 97d4d4cf.
  Acceptance (addenda/ADD-01-document-intake.md A04):
  - [x] A folder of mixed bills and receipts is read and worked through by keyboard, each accepted draft posting exactly what was reviewed (`doc_review_flow`, `doc_review_post` light and dark; form-to-body digest tests for bill, card and check).
  - [x] Every filled field links to its spot in the docked and popped-out viewer; click to fill works (compare unit tests, `doc_compare`; pointer drags not scriptable, see follow-ups).
  - [x] No duplicate expense for a receipt already in the register (`doc_review_attach`: closed-period attach adds no record, the file lands on check 4401).
  Reviews: plan review (opus), security reviews of U-95 and protocol 4 (2 Medium + 7 Low, fixed), combined review (2 blocking: closing password before the register search, failed search posts; 5 should-fix, 6 low; all fixed), ui-verifier (12 items, fixed).
  Also: xtask finds the shared build dir through cargo metadata; usage rules Q-301 in force from this phase; owner answered A06's balance line (CSV report amounts) and U-94 (go).
  Agents: scout/opus, architect/opus, impl/opus (WPs, fix pass), engine-impl/opus (U-95, U-97), security-review/opus ×2, review/opus, ui-verifier/opus, docs-writer/sonnet.
- 2026-10-26 — A03 (ADD-01) complete on `phase/A03-local-reading`; PR with auto-merge. Shipped:
  - `cl-docread` (rules: amounts, dates, header fields, kind, line tables, reconciliation checks, vendor and card matching, vendor layout templates, duplicate keys, AI amount gate) and the sandboxed `clientledger-docread` worker started by cl-host (protocol v3). Untrusted PDFs and pictures are parsed only in the worker or tesseract.
  - OCR: Tesseract 5.5.3 + Leptonica 1.87.0 built from pinned source by `xtask ocr-build` (no network code, linkage allowlist), `tessdata_fast` eng + osd and `tessdata_best` eng for a second read of unsure pages (`xtask ocr-models`, SHA-256 pinned); clean-up, orientation, levelling, OCR fallback for PDFs without a usable text layer.
  - Limits: Windows job object (commit cap, one process, no WER; confined `unsafe` in cl-host), Linux/macOS watchdog + RLIMIT_CPU/CORE (+ data limit, PDEATHSIG, netns on Linux), 30 s/page, leftover sweep; `docread-netcheck` CI (strace) and static no-network checks.
  - Enter Bill "Read document" (offline, AI off; Accept required; checks shown, never adjust; Cancel; "Couldn't read…"), one button with "Ask AI to help" behind the new cloud consents (text / pictures, off for all; P17's receipt OCR path closed); CLI `clientledger-cli read`; "Card ends in" on credit card accounts.
  - cl-api: document drafts, vendor templates, card last 4, assist, consent switches, archive omit/reset; engine U-92 (#178) and U-92d (#179) merged, pin 38cf97eb; a88337e3 archive restores.
  - Synthetic set (25 layouts + held-out, scans and photos) via `xtask gen-invoices` and the accuracy harness/CI gate.
  Acceptance (addenda/ADD-01-document-intake.md A03; Q-285 as amended by the owner 2026-10-26):
  - [x] AI off, network off: header fields ≥ 95 % on text PDFs (100 % seen and held-out) and ≥ 85 % on scans/photos (scan 95–100 %, photo 88–100 %, PDFs without a text layer 85.7–100 %), 750 documents.
  - [x] Saved template: ≥ 98 % on text PDFs (100 %); scans/photos with a template ≥ 85 % (owner amendment).
  - [x] Non-reconciling totals flagged, never adjusted (T10/T11 incl. AI-filled values and no-subtotal receipts).
  - [x] Speed: text 0.1 s/page, OCR p95 ≤ 2 s/page (CI timings; owner has no minimum-hardware machine, Q-A03n).
  - [x] Malformed or hostile files can't crash or hang the desktop (sandbox, limits, hostile fixtures, security review).
  Reviews: plan review (process-reviewer/opus xhigh: 8 must-change, fixed in the revised plan); security reviews of the sandbox (5 Medium, fixed), U-92 (2 Medium + 10 Low, fixed) and U-92d (3 Medium + 7 Low, fixed); fresh-eyes review (2 blocking: consent display vs engine, AI-filled values unreconciled; 8 should-fix; all fixed); ui-verifier (bill scenario wait, stray grid notice, outdated AI notice, accessibility; fixed). Deviation: the reading banner uses warning colours and an Accept button (non-negotiable 4) where the mockup shows an info banner.
  Also: ADD-02 (A06, read a vendor statement into Match Vendor Statement) added on owner request; P18 on hold by the owner.
  Agents: scout/opus, architect/opus ×2, process-reviewer/opus xhigh, impl/opus (WP-0, A, B, C, A2 ×2, F, G, G-cloud, card last 4, sandbox fix, review fixes ×2, pin, docs), engine-impl/opus (U-92, U-92 fixes, U-92d, U-92d fixes, U-92d CI), security-review/opus ×3, review/opus, ui-verifier/opus.
- 2026-10-26 — A02 (ADD-01) complete on `phase/A02-popout-viewer`; PR with auto-merge. Shipped:
  - Viewer formats: PDF (PDFium), JPG, PNG and multi-page TIFF (`tiff` 0.11, deflate/LZW/fax only; JPEG-in-TIFF refused before any decode, Q-A02k); zoom menu (fit page, fit width, %), rotate (view only, Q-A02b), pan, page thumbnails.
  - Pop out / Dock (button and Ctrl+Shift+D): one deferred egui viewport (Q-A02a) that follows the active form or inbox item, titled with the form's name and the company stripe; placement and zoom remembered per OS user in `doc-viewer.json`, clamped to visible monitors, brought back beside the main window when its monitor is gone (Q-A02c); closing it never touches the form. F6 moves focus between form and viewer (Q-A02g).
  - Viewer everywhere: Enter Bill, Write Check (docked pane), receipt inbox, document tab, and new attachments on card charges (draft linked after save, save waits for uploads, Q-A02e) and register items ("Show document", Q-A02f).
  - Control channel drives a second window (`viewport: doc_viewer` on every step, `state.doc_viewer`, per-window screenshots).
  - HEIC research (owner, Q-292): no permissive decoder; the "save as JPG or PDF" tip stays (Q-A02d).
  Acceptance (addenda/ADD-01-document-intake.md A02):
  - [x] Formats, zoom, rotate, pan, thumbnails (WP-A tests; document-view scenario).
  - [x] Pop out / Dock, one reused window following the active form, title and stripe, placement and zoom remembered, closing never affects the form (shell tests incl. two Shells on one store for restart, Q-A02j; doc_viewer scenario).
  - [x] F6 and Ctrl+Shift+D in the keymap, Window menu and KEYBOARD.md; keymap conflict test.
  - [x] Every attachment: bills, checks, card charges, register items (scenarios bill, write_check, card_charge, register, receipt_inbox; contract test for draft files linking onto a saved record).
  - [x] Tests: doc_viewer scenario (pop out, follow, dock, F6, rotate, page, placement move); gone-monitor clamp (seeded 20k-case loop).
  Reviews: fresh-eyes review (2 blocking: a JPEG-in-TIFF memory bomb and card-charge files lost when Save beat an upload; 6 should-fix), ui-verifier (toolbar overflow in narrow panels, Bill card cut off, 200% pop-out clipping, a clipping check that missed it). All fixed in one fix pass except those listed in Follow-ups from A02. ui-checks doc_viewer, bill, write_check, card_charge, register, receipt_inbox and document-view pass light and dark.
  Agents: architect/opus, impl/opus (WP-A, WP-B, WP-C, WP-D, fix pass), review/opus, ui-verifier/opus.
